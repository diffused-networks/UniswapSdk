# UniswapSharp

A C# / .NET port of the official Uniswap SDK - the `sdk-core` and `v3-sdk` TypeScript
packages from [Uniswap/sdks](https://github.com/Uniswap/sdks). It lets .NET applications
work with Uniswap V3: model currencies, tokens, pools, positions, routes and trades;
run the tick, sqrt-price, swap and liquidity math; and encode transaction calldata for
the V3 periphery contracts.

## Project status

- Target framework: **.NET 10** (`net10.0`)
- V3 core (entities + math) is implemented and unit-tested
- 1920 xUnit v3 tests; all passing (see Outstanding work)
- All calldata / action-builder stubs are now implemented and test-covered (no `NotImplementedException` left)
- Published to NuGet as `UniswapSharp` (latest: **2.0.1**)

## Layout

```

    Entities/        # Token, Ether, NativeCurrency, Fractions (Fraction, Percent, Price, CurrencyAmount)
    Utils/           # AddressValidator, MathUtils, PriceImpact, RlpEncoder, SortedInsert, ...

```

Namespaces and file names deliberately mirror the upstream TypeScript so the two can be
read side by side.

## Build and test

```bash
dotnet build -c Release
dotnet test  -c Release
```

The projects target `net10.0` and require the .NET 10 SDK; no `DOTNET_ROLL_FORWARD` is needed.

Tests run on **Microsoft.Testing.Platform (MTP)**, not VSTest — xunit.v3 4.x dropped the VSTest
bridge on the .NET 10 SDK. `global.json` opts `dotnet test` into the MTP runner; keep it. MTP
reporting flags go after `--` and replace the VSTest ones (`--report-trx` for `--logger trx`,
`--coverage --coverage-output-format cobertura` for `--collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"`).

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, which calls the reusable `_test.yml`) restores, builds in
Release, and runs the tests on ubuntu/windows/macos — publishing a PR test-result check, a
coverage comment, and a `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` table. CodeQL runs via `codeql.yml`.

Dependabot is **security-updates only** (`.github/dependabot.yml` sets
`open-pull-requests-limit: 0`). Routine currency is handled by periodic, test-verified sweeps
rather than a stream of individual bump PRs.

## Dependencies

- **Nethereum** 6.1.0 (`Nethereum.ABI`, `.Contracts`, `.Util`, `.Web3`) - ABI encoding,
  contract calls, address / keccak utilities. An explicit `Newtonsoft.Json` 13.0.4 pin overrides
  the vulnerable 11.0.2 that `Nethereum.Hex` still drags in transitively (NU1903).
- **ExtendedNumerics.BigRational** 3000.0.2.132 - exact rational arithmetic for the fraction and price types
- **BouncyCastle.Cryptography** 2.7.0 - Ed25519 (EdDSA) for the tamperproof-transactions port;
  `System.Security.Cryptography` has no managed Ed25519 on `net10.0`
- **xunit.v3** 4.0.0 + **AwesomeAssertions** 9.6.0, on Microsoft.Testing.Platform:
  `Microsoft.Testing.Extensions.TrxReport` + `.CodeCoverage` replace the old
  `coverlet.collector` / VSTest data collectors (test project only)

## Porting methodology

This is a line-for-line port of the upstream SDK. When implementing or fixing anything:

1. **Find the upstream source of truth first.** The reference is the official monorepo
   [Uniswap/sdks](https://github.com/Uniswap/sdks), packages `sdk-core` and `v3-sdk`.
   Read the matching `.ts` file before writing C#.
2. **Port the tests too.** Every upstream module has a `.test.ts` beside it. Port those
   cases to xUnit so behaviour is verified against the reference, not assumed.
3. **Match numeric behaviour to the digit.** Rounding, tick boundaries and fixed-point
   math must agree with upstream exactly. Prefer `BigInteger` / `BigRational` over `double`;
   never use floating point in protocol math.
4. **Keep the suite green.** Run the tests after each change; do not add code without a
   test that pins its behaviour.

File mapping for the outstanding stubs (paths relative to `sdks/v3-sdk/src/` upstream):

| C# file | Upstream reference |
|---|---|
| `V3/SwapQuoter.cs` | `quoter.ts` (+ `quoter.test.ts`) |
| `V3/NonfungiblePositionManager.cs` | `nonfungiblePositionManager.ts` |
| `V3/Payments.cs` | `payments.ts` |
| `V3/Utils/PositionLibrary.cs` (`SubIn256`) | `utils/tickLibrary.ts` (`subIn256`) |
| `V3/Utils/PriceTick.cs` | `utils/priceTickConversions.ts` |

## Conventions

- Nullable reference types and implicit usings are enabled; keep new code warning-clean.
- Public types mirror upstream names (PascalCase equivalents of the TS exports).
- Amounts and prices flow through the `Fraction` types - keep floating point out of protocol math.
- Work on a branch, keep commits small, and run the tests before each commit.

## Software-engineering process (required)

- **Always use PRs.** Branch off `main` (`feat/…`, `fix/…`, `chore/…`, `docs/…`, `ci/…`, `test/…`),
  small Conventional-Commit commits, PR into `main`, CI green, squash-merge, linear history.
  Never push directly to `main`.
- **Test-first, always.** Port/write the failing test before the implementation. Keep the suite
  green (`dotnet test -c Release`).
- **Match upstream to the digit.** `BigInteger`/`BigRational` only; never floating point in
  protocol math. See [docs/PORTING.md](docs/PORTING.md) for the mapping + methodology.
- **Definition of done (ported module):** upstream `.ts` + `.test.ts` ported and green;
  `docs/PORTING.md` row updated; `dotnet format --verify-no-changes` clean; CI green.

## Outstanding work

Phase A (repository foundations) is complete: .NET 10, CI with PR reporting/coverage/CodeQL/Dependabot,
branch protection + security hardening, community-health files, docs, and NuGet packaging are all in
place. Remaining work is **Phase B** (V3 feature-parity port) and beyond.

1. **Phase B — first pass: dependency-update sweep (test-verified)** - DONE. All six deferred major
   bumps landed, each behind a green suite (194/194) and with numeric parity verified to the digit for
   the runtime deps:
   - **Runtime (protocol-math critical):** `Nethereum.ABI` / `.Contracts` / `.Util` / `.Web3`
     `4.21.4` → `6.1.0` (#28, plus an explicit `Newtonsoft.Json` `13.0.4` pin to clear the transitive
     NU1903 / GHSA-5crp-9r3c-p9vr); `ExtendedNumerics.BigRational` `2023.1000.2.328` → `3000.0.2.132` (#29).
   - **Test infrastructure:** `coverlet.collector` `6.0.2` → `10.0.1`, `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk`
     `17.11.0` → `18.7.0`, full `xunit` v2 → `xunit.v3` `3.2.2` (+ `xunit.runner.visualstudio` `3.1.5`,
     dropped `XunitContext`; converted the `async void` tests to `async Task`) (#27).
   - **CI:** `actions/setup-dotnet` → `v5.4.0` (node24) across all workflows to clear the Node-20
     deprecation, stale `# v4`/`# v2`/`# v3` action version comments corrected, and `codeql-action/analyze`
     aligned to `init` at v4.37.0 (#26).

   **Second pass (2026-09) — DONE.** The 12 Dependabot PRs that had accumulated since were landed as
   one verified sweep behind a green 1695-test suite: `xunit.v3` `3.2.2` → `4.0.0`,
   `xunit.runner.visualstudio` `3.1.5` → `4.0.0`, `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk` `18.7.0` → `18.9.0`,
   `AwesomeAssertions` `9.4.0` → `9.6.0`, `BouncyCastle.Cryptography` `2.5.1` → `2.7.0`,
   `MinVer` `6.0.0` → `7.0.0`, `Microsoft.SourceLink.GitHub` `8.0.0` → `10.0.400`, plus the five
   action pins. The `xunit.v3` major forced the **VSTest → Microsoft.Testing.Platform** migration
   (`global.json`, MTP reporting flags in `_test.yml`, `coverlet.collector` replaced by
   `Microsoft.Testing.Extensions.CodeCoverage` + `.TrxReport`). Dependabot was switched to
   security-updates-only at the same time.
2. **Upstream parity sweep `6081b3e` → `35c4e35`** - DONE (2026-09-02). Five dependency-ordered PRs
   (#100, #101, #102, #103, #104 + the launch-surface PR), each test-first and green, per
   [docs/design/2026-09-02-upstream-parity-design.md](docs/design/2026-09-02-upstream-parity-design.md).
   Cleared four real bugs the port had inherited — `MixedRouteSDK.MidPrice` inverted across
   native/wrapped boundaries, the `ACROSS_V4_DEPOSIT_V3` flat encoding that made every bridge deposit
   undecodable on-chain, unfloored V4 exact-out legs, and sepolia's `TickLensAddress` pointing at
   multicall — and added the direct-transfer, quick-launch and instant-launch surfaces. Carries one
   breaking change (`BuildPositionDefinitions`, upstream #651), so the next release is **2.0.0**.

2. **Seven `NotImplementedException` stubs** - DONE. All ported test-first (upstream `.test.ts`
   cases, calldata matched to the digit): `PositionLibrary.SubIn256` (#32), `PriceTick` (#34),
   `Payments` (#35), `SwapQuoter` (#36), and `NonfungiblePositionManager` (create/add #39,
   collect/remove #40, safeTransferFrom/getPermitData #41). Along the way this also fixed
   `EncodeRouteToPath` (#31) and `Multicall.EncodeMulticall` (#37), which were broken at runtime,
   and added the `Position.MintAmountsWithSlippage` prerequisite (#38). `grep -r
   NotImplementedException src/` is now empty.
3. **`CurrencyAmount.ToExact` hardening** - DONE. Reimplemented with exact `BigInteger` arithmetic
   (Decimal.js parity); the old `(decimal)` cast overflowed for large amounts. Hardened test-first,
   incl. a max-uint256 case (`CurrencyAmountTests.cs`).
4. **NuGet packaging** - DONE (metadata, SourceLink, symbols, MinVer `v`-prefixed tag-driven release).
   Publishing uses **NuGet Trusted Publishing (OIDC, keyless)** via `release.yml`: configure a trusted-publishing
   policy on nuget.org (owner `grinidx`, repo `UniswapSharp`, workflow `release.yml`), set the `NUGET_USER`
   repo secret to your nuget.org profile username, then push a `v*` tag. No long-lived API key is stored.
5. **README + usage example** - DONE (see `README.md` + `docs/PORTING.md`); keep in sync as stubs land.
6. **V4 (later phase)** - Uniswap V4 reuses V3's concentrated-liquidity math (ticks,
   sqrt-price) and adds the singleton `PoolManager`, hooks and flash accounting. It is
   additive on top of this codebase, not a rewrite. Reference: `sdks/v4-sdk`.
